{"name":"Donnect","tagline":"If you can't connect it, donnect it!","body":"![Logo (Unofficial)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mushyshah/Donnect/master/Screenshots/donnecticon.png)\r\n##Welcome to the webpage for Donnect!\r\nWhat is Donnect? _( done - nect )_ Well as the name may suggest (not very obvious ways), it's a game about _connecting dots_. \r\nWhat's the challenge? Well it may seem trivial, but once you realize that you can't intersect your line once you've drawn it, you'll be left circling the very little space left on the screen to connect the rest of the dots. Sure it's just connecting dots, but when you're left without any space trying to circle back and forth to the 8th dot, that's when you'll realize that it's a real strain on your brain. The challenge will keep you coming back for more!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFighting the battle with a one man army - Mustafa Shah(@mushyshah)\r\n\r\n### What's the inspiration behind this game?\r\nI remember when I was too young to play video games, I would often play fun little board games with friends. Sometimes I miss the simple life with simple games. Eventually it struck me, there should probably be a game like this on the play store! Alas, there were none (only similar, but drastically different concept games) that I could find. I decided to take it upon myself to develop one! ~~and to get rich ofcourse~~\r\n\r\n###What platforms will it support?\r\nFor the time being, I'm only developing android. Depending on how it turns out, I might end up extending it onto BlackBerry and maybe IOS too.     \r\n\r\n**__________________________________Less-Interesting-Stuff__________________________________**\r\n\r\n### Progress \r\n- Designed a basic whiteboard themed background.\r\n- Implemented basic drawing capabilities using basic android graphics/bitmaps etc\r\n- Designed the (unofficial) Donnect logo!\r\n- Imported cocos2d (shoutout to the cocos2d team).
